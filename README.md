# link-state-routing-implementation
Implementation of link state routing using Dijkstra algorithm in Java

> Link state routing uses Dijkstra's algorithm to build routing tables for all the routers in its network. 
> OSPF protocol uses link state routing which uses Dijkstra's algorithm. 

### This is CLI program which 
1. Constructs the network of the routers
2. Form the routing tables for all the routers in the network
3. Simulate the network path between the routers

### Input required:
1. Number of routers and number of links between them
2. The network link between two routers with their weight
3. 2 router nodes to simulate the network path between them
